## Availability of Additional Data

Structural MRI data are protected and available upon request. To access this data, please contact us. You will need to sign a Data Use Agreement (DUA) to gain access to these data (access granted for researchers).

Description of the MRI data: MRI experiments were conducted using a Siemens Prisma FIT 3T scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 64-channel phased-array RF head coil. Structural images were acquired with the following parameters: a repetition time (TR) of 2400 ms, an inversion time (TI) of 1000 ms, an echo time (TE) of 2.74 ms, a flip angle of 8 degrees, a field of view (FOV) of 256x256 mm, and a voxel size of 0.8x0.8x0.8 mm. The total acquisition time (TA) for T1-weighted images was 6 minutes and 52 seconds. All MRI files underwent "defacing" using the fsl_deface algorithm (FSL 6.0.6.4 software on Ubuntu).
